        Whereas the Title can only make the simplest statement about the content of your article, 
        the Abstract allows you to elaborate more on each major aspect of the paper. The length of 
        your Abstract should be kept to about 200-300 words maximum (a typical standard length for journals.)
        Limit your statements concerning each segment of the paper (i.e. purpose, methods, results, etc.)
        to two or three sentences, if possible. The Abstract helps readers decide whether they want to read 
        the rest of the paper, or it may be the only part they can obtain via electronic literature searches
        or in published abstracts. Therefore, enough key information (e.g., summary results, observations, trends, etc.)
        must be included to make the Abstract useful to someone who may to reference your work.
